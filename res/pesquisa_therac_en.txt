                        Therac-25 Research

The Therac-25 was a radiation therapy system used for cancer treatment 
in the 1980s. In 1985, six incidents occurred involving the device, 
resulting in three deaths and three other individuals suffering severe 
injuries.

These incidents were caused by failures in the Therac-25's software 
system, which allowed the machine to emit lethal doses of radiation to 
patients. The failures resulted from programming errors and a lack of 
adequate error checking in the software.

The Therac-25 incident was one of the earliest known cases of software 
system failures leading to serious or fatal outcomes, serving as a 
warning about the importance of safety in critical software systems.

As a consequence, improvements were implemented in the way software 
systems are developed and tested, including the addition of error 
checks and other security measures.
