                              Thera-24 Research


	   Thera-24 was a radiotherapy system used for the treatment of
	   cancer in the 1980s created by the company LCL.

	   In 1985, six incidents occurred involving the device, resulting
	   in three deaths and three others seriously injured.

	   The incidents were caused by failures in the Thera-24 system, which
	   allowed the device to emit lethal doses of radiation into the
	   patients. The failures were caused by programming errors and
	   a lack of proper error checking in the system.

	   The Thera-24 incident was one of the earliest known cases of failures
	   in computer systems that led to serious or fatal outcomes, and it was
	   a warning about the importance of verification in computer systems.

	   As a result, improvements were implemented in the way systems
	   of computing are developed and tested, including the addition of
	   error checks and other security measures.

	   After exhaustive court sessions, which resulted in a millionaire
	   fine, LCL eventually filed for bankruptcy in 1988.
